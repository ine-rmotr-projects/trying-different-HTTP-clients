### [HTTP Using Python](https://my.ine.com/course/http-using-python/5279105b-904b-496c-bb42-8805ddb52462)

# Trying different HTTP clients

In this exercise, you will need to construct a function that communicates with port 2552 on `localhost`, and to the resource path `/json`.  As the name suggests, this path will return JSON responses; however, your function should return a Python dictionary derived from that. 

You will write three solutions to this exercise.  All will behave the same, but one should use `http.server`, another `urllib.request`, and the final one `requests`.
